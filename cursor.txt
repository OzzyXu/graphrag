OK. Now let's do some big updates for the project. What I would like to do is a overhaul for the causal-analysis workflow I added. Here is the thing I plan to do. 1. Remove the causal-analysis workflow. We may be able to keep some components depending on the next a few steps.  2. I want to add a new search method called causal_search. The search works like the following: first, suppose the the local_search extracts top-k nodes based on the users query, the causal_search has a parameter s, then the causal_search will extract k+s nodes. Second, utilize the local_search workflow existing components to extract other graph information like relationship in the local search. Third, after extracting all the graph information, use the prompt stored in /Users/chuan/Projects/graphrag/causal_discovery_prompt.txt to create a causal report. The graph information extracted before should be attached to the ---Network Data--- part of the prompt. 4. Use the prompt stored in /Users/chuan/Projects/graphrag/causal_summary_report.txt to create the response for users' query. The causal summary report should be attached to the ---Causal Summary--- part of the prompt. 5. The workflow should also be able to take user given causal summary as input. So you need to output the extracted graph information in the causal_search method somewhere. During the overhaul, the added causal_search method should have corresponding control parameter like s mentioned before, and other things like context length. Analyse my plan first. After checking the code, list your plan step by step or give me a todo list. Proceed with the plan after I approve it. If you have any questions and needs clarification, please ask me.
