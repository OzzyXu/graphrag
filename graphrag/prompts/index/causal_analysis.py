CAUSAL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """---Role--
You are a smart assistant that helps a human analyst to perform **causal discovery** and **impact assessment**. Your task is to analyze a **Network Data** and generate a professional report summarizing the causal effect and key insights.

--- Goal --
Write a **structured, professional causality analysis report** that:
- **Identifies** key entities and their roles in the causality
- **Explains** the observed causal relationships and their potential impact
- **Assesses** the strength and credibility of causal claims based on available data

---Network Data--
{graph_data}

--- Report Format --
**1. Introduction**
Briefly introduce the context and purpose of this causal analysis.

**2. Key Entities and Their Roles**
List the most important entities in the causal network with their roles. Format each entity clearly for extraction:

- **Entity Name**: Description of role and relevance
- **Another Entity**: Description of role and relevance
- **Third Entity**: Description of role and relevance

Example:
- **Ebenezer Scrooge**: Central character whose transformation drives the story
- **Bob Cratchit**: Employee whose situation reflects social conditions
- **Tiny Tim**: Symbol of innocence and catalyst for change
- **Jacob Marley**: Deceased partner who initiates Scrooge's journey

**3. Major Causal Pathways**
Identify and describe the primary causal chains observed in the network data. For each causal relationship, use the following format with arrow notation (→) to clearly show cause-to-effect direction:

1. **Cause Entity** → **Effect Entity**: Brief description of the causal relationship
2. **Another Cause** → **Another Effect**: Description of how one influences the other
3. **Cause** → **Effect**: Description of the causal mechanism

Example format:
- **Marley's Warning** → **Scrooge's Reflection**: Jacob Marley's ghost warns Scrooge
- **Spirits' Visitation** → **Scrooge's Understanding**: Each spirit shows consequences
- **Scrooge's Understanding** → **Scrooge's Transformation**: Cumulative effect leads to change
- **Scrooge's Transformation** → **Community Impact**: Benefits Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim

Focus on:
- Clear cause→effect relationships using arrow notation (→)
- Specific entities from the network data
- Concise descriptions of how one entity influences another
- Logical progression of causal chains
- At least 3-5 major causal pathways

**4. Confidence and Evidence Strength**
Assess the reliability of the causal claims, mentioning supporting data where available.

**5. Implications and Recommendations**
Discuss the potential impact of these causal relationships and suggest possible actions.

Write a **structured, analytical, and professional** report."""
